TO DO LIST:

Michael Bigler

- KNN
* 
- Discriminant Analysis
* Smallest class sufficiently large (20 records)
* Sensitive to outliers -> EA flag outliers and maybe remove them
* correlation structure between different predictors within class is the same as accross classes (Correlation matrix for each class and compare)
* if correlations differ substantially -> classifier will tend to classify records into class with larger variability
* when big difference and data set large -> quadratic discriminant analysis
* fit model -> see if it works -> revisit outliers and choice of predictors
* In case of unequal classes -> add log(probability) to function -> 12.5
* Misclassifiaction costs -> add log(cost1) and log(cost2) to function -> 12.6 (also in combinatio with before)
* normality is assumed -> log transform might help
* outliers have huge impact -> needs deletion of them and in depth outlier analysis
